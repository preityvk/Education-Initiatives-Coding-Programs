I. Behavioral Design Patterns Programs:
1. Strategy Pattern (Sorting Algorithms): The Strategy design pattern, which lets the client select an algorithm at runtime, is demonstrated by this software. Throughout the program, classes that implement the `SortStrategy` interface include implementations of the various sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort). The `SortingAlgorithm} class serves as a context that enables the client to select and alter various sorting techniques. The client code demonstrates how to use any sorting technique while maintaining the integrity of the underlying client logic.
2. Memento Pattern (Text Editor): The Memento design pattern, which records and saves an object's state for later restoration, is exemplified by this application. The object whose state (string content) is being recorded is represented by the `StringEditor` class. The `History` class takes care of the `StringEditor`, saving and restoring its many states, while the `Memento` class keeps track of its current state. The application shows how to save many `StringEditor` states and then return it to a prior state.

II. Creational Design Patterns Programs:
1. Maze Solver (Depth-First Search): This software uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) method to solve a maze. A 2D array is used to depict the labyrinth, with {1} denoting walls and {0} denoting open areas. The `solveMaze` function iteratively navigates the labyrinth, noting cells that have been visited and retracing steps if needed. The path is printed if the solution is discovered. The software shows how to use recursive backtracking in a DFS algorithm to solve a maze.
2. Circle Circumference Calculation: This little program generates a `Circle` class that takes a radius and returns the circle's circumference. The formula `2 * Ï€ * radius} is applied using the `calculateCircumference()` function. The `main` function shows how to create a {Circle} object with a radius of {5} and report the circumference that has been computed.

III. Structural Based Patterns Programs:
1. Adapter Pattern (Bird and Duck):  This application demonstrates the **Adapter design pattern**, which enables the coexistence of two incompatible interfaces. A `Duck} object's behavior may be modified using the `DuckAdapter} class so that it behaves more like a `Bird} interface. The `Duck} may fly and emit a sound ({quack}) when using the `Bird} interface methods thanks to the adaptor. The `main} function shows how to include `Duck` functionality into `Bird} interface expectations by utilizing the adaptor.
2. Bridge Design Pattern: The Bridge design pattern is demonstrated by this software, which separates the abstraction (Vehicle) from the implementation (Engine). The `Car` class is capable of working with several engine types since it accepts a `Engine} object and implements the `Vehicle` interface. Implementations of concrete engines include {DieselEngine~ and {PetrolEngine}, each having a separate `start()} function. Two automobiles with various engines are built in the main function to demonstrate how the car may work with both gasoline and diesel engines without being inextricably linked to a particular implementation."""
